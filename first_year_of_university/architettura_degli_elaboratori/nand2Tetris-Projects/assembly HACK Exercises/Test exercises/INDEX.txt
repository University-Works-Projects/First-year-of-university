TEST EXERCISES

EXERCISE #1 V - Transale C code

    Assuming that RAM[0] = i and RAM[1] = j.
    Write the relative assembly HACK code of this C program:

        if (i - 3 == 0) {
            j = j - 1;
        } else {
            j = j * 3;
        }
        
EXERCISE #2 V - Write code

    Write a assembly HACK code that writes the numbers 0 to 9 in the first 10 RAM's location.

EXERCISE #3 V - Write code

    Write a assembly HACK code that writes the number 10 from RAM[40] to RAM[50]

EXERCISE #4 V - Transale C code

    Assuming that RAM[0] = i and RAM[1] = j.
    Write the relative assembly HACK code of this C program:

        if (i > j) {
            j = j - 5;
        } else {
            i = i + j;
        }
